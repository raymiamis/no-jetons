# no-jetons
This is a site you can use if you want to play blackjack with your friends, but don't have any jetons.

# Instruction
  1. Set the correct amount of jetons you want to start with.
  2. Adjust your bet you want to make each round.
  3. If you won or lost, click the corresponding button, if you broke even with the dealer, click "Even".
     If you want to double, adjust your bet. Same goes for splitting, as it's not implemented as of right now.
